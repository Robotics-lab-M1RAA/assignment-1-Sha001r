    g) It is observed that the rosnode /rosout is listed as a running node even after killing it, it is also observed that the rosnode can be killed by killing  the rosmaster.

    h) rosnode cleanup : purge registration information of unreachable nodes
       rosnode info :	print information about node
       rosnode kill :	kill a running node
       rosnode list :	list active nodes
       rosnode machine : ist nodes running on a particular machine or list machines
       rosnode ping :	test connectivity to node
